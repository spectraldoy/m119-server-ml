# Arduino Server and ML demo

To run the server run the following from the `server/` folder, on your ser ver

```
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80
```

Then, you can open the Arduino file in `client/` from the Arduino IDE, upload it to your board (this demo was written for Arduino Nano 33 IoT), and run it.
